Brad Green is a software developer with a background in music and education.
He received a bachelor's degree in Instrumental Performance from Northern
Arizona University and a master's degree in Saxophone Performance from the
University of Oregon, where he was also a Graduate Teaching Fellow. Brad performed
at numerous conferences and masterclasses, won multiple competitions, and
received numerous awards for his performances.

Despite a successful music career, Brad's true passion was discovered while
taking an elective introductory web development course in college. Even though the
requirements of a master's degree and teaching fellowship occupied a great
deal of time, Brad simply could not stop programming. It was then he knew that
he wanted to pursue a career in software development. After completing his
master's degree, Brad was accepted to Turing School of Software and Development, a
seven-month code school based in Denver, Colorado. At Turing, Brad spent 60-80+
hours per week learning the fundamentals of object-oriented programming with Ruby,
building web applications and providing/consuming APIs with Ruby on Rails, and
gaining exposure to agile project management, Javascript basics, and much more.

Turing was just the beginning for Brad. He is committed to refining his skills,
exploring new technologies, and building software that makes a positive difference
in the world.
