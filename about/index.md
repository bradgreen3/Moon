I am a software developer with a background in music and education.
I received a bachelor's degree in Instrumental Performance from Northern
Arizona University and a master's degree in Saxophone Performance from the
University of Oregon, where I was also a Graduate Teaching Fellow. I have
performed at numerous conferences and masterclasses, won multiple competitions,
and received numerous awards for my performances.

My true passion was discovered while taking an elective introductory web
development course in college. Even though the requirements of a master's degree
and teaching fellowship occupied a great deal of time, I could not stop
tinkering with and perfecting the assignments for the web development course.
I took another class and did more self study, and it wasn't long before I
decided I wanted to pursue a career as a software developer.

After completing my master's degree, I was accepted to Turing School of Software
and Development, a seven-month code school based in Denver, Colorado. At Turing,
I spent 60-80+ hours per week learning the fundamentals of object-oriented
programming with Ruby, building web applications and providing/consuming APIs
with Ruby on Rails, and gaining exposure to agile project management, Javascript
basics, and much more.

Turing was just the beginning. I am committed to refining my skills,
exploring new technologies, and building software that makes a positive difference
in the world.
