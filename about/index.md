I am a software developer with a background in music and education.
I received a bachelor's degree in Instrumental Performance from Northern
Arizona University and a master's degree in Saxophone Performance from the
University of Oregon, where I was also a Graduate Teaching Fellow. I have
performed at numerous conferences and masterclasses, won multiple competitions,
and received numerous awards for my performances.

I discovered my true passion while taking an introductory web development course
in college. Despite the rigors of graduate coursework and a teaching fellowship,
I could not stop tinkering with and perfecting assignments for the web development
course. It wasn't long before I knew I wanted to pursue a career as a software
developer.

After completing my master's degree, I was accepted to Turing School of Software
and Design, a seven-month code school based in Denver, Colorado. At Turing,
I spent 60-80+ hours per week learning the fundamentals of object-oriented
programming with Ruby, building web applications and providing/consuming APIs
with Ruby on Rails, and gaining exposure to agile project management, Javascript
basics, and much more.

Turing was just the beginning. I am committed to refining my skills,
exploring new technologies, and building software that makes a positive difference
in the world.
