## Overview

 RepList modernizes the way classical musicians document repertoire they've performed. Users can easily create and share their list with others. YouTube videos can be uploaded to pieces, and users can like, comment, and view comments videos attached to other users' lists. With RepList, PDF documents and disorganized recordings are a thing of the past.

## Areas of Focus

This project was completed individually. It utilizes Ruby on Rails, Google OAuth2, low-level caching, BCrypt, AJAX, and the YouTube API. Testing is done with RSpec and Capybara.
